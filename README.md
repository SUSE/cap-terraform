# End-to-end CAP 2 deployment for public cloud platforms with Terraform

The goal is to setup a cluster, configure dependencies(storage classes, helm 3) and perform helm installs for CAP, Stratos and Metrics.
In cap-1.5.x setups, UAA and SCF are deployed with an nginx Ingress Controller but Stratos and Metrics are deployed with LoadBalancer services. Letsencrypt issued certificates are issued for UAA/SCF but self-signed certificates are used for Stratos and Metrics deployments.

In capt-2.x setup, CAP, Stratos and Metrics services are exposed through a single Ingress Controller with different ingress rules. The top-level domain is the same for all deployments, Stratos is deployed with a stratos subdomain and Metrics with a metrics subdomain so they can be accessed at stratos.<TLD> and metrics.<TLD> FQDNs. Letsencrypt certificates are issued for CAP, Stratos and Metrics.

The inputs are provided  through terraform variables (for use with [blue-horizon](https://github.com/SUSE-Enceladus/blue-horizon)). For details on how to use the templates for specific providers see the respective READMEs in the provider directories.
